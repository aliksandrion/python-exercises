## Description
Here are the collection of test tasks.
The easiest tasks with a description are in the folder "Easy".

### reverse_tic_tac_toe
The game "Reverse tic-tacâ€“toe" against the computer on a 10 x 10 field with the rule "Five in a row".
The one who has a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row of five of his figures loses.

### cyclic_iterator
We need to write a *CyclicIterator* class.
The iterator should iterate over the iterated object (list, tuple, set, range, etc.), and start over when it reaches the last element.

### decorator_cache
A decorator function has been written that will save the value of the decorated function *multiplier*. 
If the decorated function is called again with the same parameters, the decorator must return the saved result without executing the function.

### decorator_time_to_time
The decorator re-performs the decorated function after a while.
Uses a naive exponential growth of the repeat time (*factor*) to the boundary timeout (*border_sleep_time*).

### movie_schedule
*schedule* method in the *Movie* class generates the days on which the movie is shown.

### shortest_way
